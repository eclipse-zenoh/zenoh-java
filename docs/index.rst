==========
zenoh-java
==========

The *zenoh-java* library provides a Java `zenoh client API <zenoh-api.html>`_ for zenoh.

An introduction to zenoh and its concepts is available on `zenoh.io <https://zenoh.io>`_.

.. warning::
    zenoh has been subjet to a complete rewrite with major protocol updates between 
    versions 0.4.2 and 0.5.0. The Java API does not yet integrate those changes and is 
    only compatible with version 0.4.2 of the zenoh daemon and the underlying zenoh-c 
    stack.

Note that this library also provides a low-level API (`zenoh-net <zenoh-net-api.html>`_)
that gives access to the zenoh protocol primitives and allow some
advanced use cases where a fine tuning of the protocol is required.
